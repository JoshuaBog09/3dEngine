3D to 2D projection is in early stage of completion

currently point double appear due to delta camera not being handle correctly (behind and before)


implement camera movement and object movement

camera movement works, the specified directions causes a mvement 


change cube coordinates to numpy to perfrom large scale transformation
    -> [[][][][][]] - np.array([[1,2,3]])
    -> based on index location the vertices can be drawn

implement variable vertice size to give the added effect of depth (draw rectangle)

create block class
